Machina is a lightweight and opinionated virtual machine manager. It uses
QEMU to start and stop kernel virtual machines on linux systems. Each virtual
machine is operated as a systemd unit.

The machina library and program are written in Go.
It is a work in progress and not recommended for production use.
